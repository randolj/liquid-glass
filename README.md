# Liquid Glass

A interactive liquid glass effect built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS based of Apple's new Liquid Glass. Features a draggable glass panel with backdrop blur and distortion effects. Just wanted to see if I could get it done and had fun making. I would like to make it easy to integrate to other projects.

## How to run
